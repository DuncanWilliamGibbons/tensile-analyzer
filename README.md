# Tensile Analyzer
This program processes and analyzes tensile test data in accordance with ASTM standards. Such data are often analyzed using spreadsheets and lack a standard methodology, which is prone to user error and tedious. This program aims to reduce such user errors and improve the accuracy and precision of the calculated mechanical properties more efficiently. 

The user can import their data file from a universal testing machine (UTM) containing force, displacement, and strain data. The program then analyzes this data to determine key mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS), elongation, reduction of area (RA), elastic modulus (EM), and monotonic properties in accordance with ASTM E8/E8M[^1] and ASTM E111[^2] requirements.

The following plots can be generated and exported:
- Stress-strain plot with annotated YS, UTS, and EM.
- Stress-strain plot with highlighted modulus of resilience and modulus of toughness areas.
- Engineering stress-strain plot overlayed with true stress-strain plot.
- Ramberg-Osgood curve fitting and parameters.

## Features
The Tensile Analyzer has the following features:
- Import data in various formats.
- Analyze data in accordance with ASTM requirements.
- Calculate mechanical properties:
  - Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) in MPa as the maximum stress achieved.
  - Yield Strength (YS) in MPa as the intersection of a 0.2% offset line and the stress-strain curve.
  - Elastic Modulus (EM) or Young's Modulus in GPa as the gradient of a fitted slope to the middle 50% of datapoints in the linear elastic region.
  - Elongation at fracture in % as the maximum extension as a percentage of the original gauge length.
  - Elongation after fracture in % as the final gauge length as a percentage of the original gauge length.
  - Reduction of Area (RA) in % as the percentage decrease in the final cross-sectional gauge area compared with the original cross-sectional gauge area.
  - Modulus of Resilience in MJ/m^3 as the area under the linear elastic region.
  - Modulus of Toughness in MJ/m^3 as the area under the full stress-strain curve.
- Plot data:
  - Stress-strain curve with annotated mechanical properties.
  - Regions of resilience and toughness moduli.
  - Engineering vs true stress-strain curve.
  - Ramberg-Osgood curve fitting.
- Export plots and results.
## Installation Instructions
To run the Tensile Analyzer program, the following prerequisite Python libraries must be installed:
```
pip install tkinter, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, os, warnings
```
After installing these prerequisites, the tensile_analyzer_XXX.py (where XXX is the relevant version of the program) file can be run in your IDE of choice, and the GUI will appear.

## Data File Format
Data files exported from the UTM testing software can be imported into the Tensile Analyzer program in the following formats:
- CSV (.csv)
- XLSM (.xlsm)
- TXT (.txt)

The data file must be formatted to contain data for columns in the format and associated metric units defined below.

### Circular cross-section specimens
| Time (s) | Extension (mm)	| Load (kN)	| Strain (mm/mm)	| Original Length (mm)	| Original Diameter (mm)	| Final Length (mm)	| Final Diameter (mm) |
### Rectangular cross-section specimens
| Time (s) | Extension (mm)	| Load (kN)	| Strain (mm/mm)	| Original Length (mm)	| Original Thickness (mm)	| Original Width (mm)	| Final Length (mm)	| Final Thickness (mm) | Final Width (mm) |
