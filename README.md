# Tensile Analyzer
This program processes and analyzes tensile test data in accordance with ASTM standards. Such data are often analyzed using spreadsheets and lack a standard methodology, which is prone to user error and tedious. This program aims to reduce such user errors and improve the accuracy and precision of the calculated mechanical properties more efficiently. 

The user can import their data file from a universal testing machine (UTM) containing force, displacement, and strain data. The program then analyzes this data to determine key mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield strength (YS), elongation, reduction of area (RA), elastic modulus (EM), and monotonic properties in accordance with ASTM E8/E8M[^1] and ASTM E111[^2] requirements.

The following plots can be generated and exported:
- Stress-strain plot with annotated YS, UTS, and EM.
- Stress-strain plot with highlighted modulus of resilience and modulus of toughness areas.
- Engineering stress-strain plot overlayed with true stress-strain plot.
- Ramberg-Osgood curve fitting and parameters.
